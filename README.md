- **Description**: A small game where colored "energy" units are moved between battery nodes until each battery is either empty or contains a single color.

**How it works (brief)**

- The main scene instantiates multiple battery scenes. Each battery holds up to 4 "energy" color units.
- Players click a battery to pick up a contiguous run of top-most energy units of the same color, then click another battery to place them if allowed by the rules.TB
